    <h1>Third Position</h1>

    <pre>

You start more coarse for want
hasn't set your own in motion.
A residue bleached rayon curtain
rises on the carmine stage.
She's raised à la arabesque
balanced atop your platelet pool
waiting with pants to lap
what lines your half of the future,
Tapping me for the second term
My anaemic tongue recaptures
all coloured flesh of you
streaking on my retinal vein's
calm pulsing, we lay you on one side
swathe in belongings of another.
Pour your torn self upon to me
clutching slips through stains placed.
Come watch our invented shades flow
hoisted up by fine tethers.
Or come see me for weeks still to come
gnawing your blood out of my cuticles.
