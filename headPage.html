        He was always one of those people, popping out of bed each morning, never hitting snooze. And he loved a morning routine. A morning fruit. Morning water. But strangely never coffee, hell, not even tea. He'd refuse any caffine you see. Didn't want to be dependant "A Slave" he'd say, and I really mean say. He'd utter aloud, just like that.

    Licking his lips, he wanted me before I stirred. I'd be soft, so with ease he could take all of me. James with lips wrapped round my base actually sucked, keeping his head in place, using his tongue to swipe it ever so slight. One way then the next. There was no prescribed order to the things he did, even sucking the air right out his mouth 'till his cheeks dimpled all the way in Jamie wanted the sensation that theres nothing in his mouth, nothing at all between him, his fragile cheek, and my flaccid willy. Now if you can make heads or tails of him when he'd say "It feels like your getting bigger, expanding in my mouth. Yet your just as you were, deflated and small inside of me" I never told him it only made me think of a fish.

    Oh! How much he loved it! He wanted nothing more to play with soft as long as we could. He hired a nanny you konw, set them up on the kids routine. If you think about it how crazy it that? He outright refused to wake, dress, feed, or take the tots to school. So Long! As for the time being my foreskin still cups the tip of my cock, so long as it still tickled the lining in his mouth. He even kept notifications off and say shit about "Never wanting this moment to end". I mean even then I wouldn't call him the most original concerning what he says in bed, but you'd have to have heard him. Heard the way he'd beg for the feeling again, my once-soft petite dick slowly regaining it's shape, flex to itself and stiffen. Already pushing further down the bend of his neck. My Jimmy gagged just once, once some August morning, once under the table as I ate my lunch, and once as I sat taking a shit before bed. In was these moments I was his "Soft little thing" And he'd lick me soft as anything, swearing he'd never be on solids again.
